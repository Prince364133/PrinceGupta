Brutal mentor note (read this carefully)
This resume is execution-heavy, which is good.​
But if you want it bulletproof:
●​ Stop calling everything a “project” once it makes money → it’s a product.
●​ Add metrics next (users, revenue, growth %). Without numbers, recruiters doubt scale.
●​ One weak line = whole resume looks weak. We can sharpen this further.
If you want, next step:
●​
●​
●​

🔥 ATS-optimized version
🔥 Founder-focused version
🔥 Resume for investors / accelerators

Brutal truth
You’re not weak technically.​
Your real risk is spreading yourself thin and not turning skills into clear dominance in 1–2
areas.
Next level questions for you:
●​ Do you want to be seen as a Founder who codes or a Developer who builds
startups?
●​ Which 3 skills do you want recruiters/investors to remember you for?
Answer that, and we’ll weaponize this list instead of just listing it.

Brutal mentor checkpoint
Don’t say “I know TypeScript” unless you can answer these without Googling:

1.​ Difference between interface vs type
2.​ Why any is dangerous and when it’s acceptable
3.​ How generics improve API safety
4.​ How TypeScript helps in large React codebases
If you’re weak on any of these, we either:
●​ fix it fast, or

Alright. Here’s the clean, factual list of startups you’ve founded or actively built. No hype. If

You have a focus problem.
Right now:
●​ Too many brands
●​ Overlapping missions
●​ Diluted narrative
If you want real scale, you eventually collapse this into:
1 main company + 1 internal product line
Next move (choose one):

●​

🔥 Merge strategy (what to kill, what to keep)
🧠 Investor-ready startup story (no cringe)
🎯 Pick ONE startup to go all-in for 12 months

Your call.

Strong Products: Hubsnap Creator OS, Snap6

●​ Kill or Pause: Anything without users or revenue in 90 days
If you want, next I’ll:
●​
●​
●​

🔥 Merge these into ONE clean founder story
🔥 Decide which names to kill, merge, or double down on
🔥 Prepare a portfolio / pitch version that doesn’t look scattered

Say the word.

If you want, next we:
●​
●​
●​

Your move.

Correct strategy:

●​ Portfolio → 8–10
●​ Personal brag list → all of them (this list)
If you want next:
●​
●​
●​

🔥 Pick the Top 5 resume websites

Done.​
That canvas is your single, clean, non-scattered founder portfolio.

Here’s why this works (and why most portfolios fail):

Why this portfolio is solid
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

One identity → not “student / freelancer / random dev”
1 flagship product → SnapShiksha carries the story
2 strong products → proves repeatability
Everything else grouped → no chaos, no brag noise
Outcome-focused language → not feature dumping

How to use it (important)
●​
●​
●​
●​

Resume: Link this page
LinkedIn: Copy the “One-Line Identity” + Flagship Product
Investors / mentors: Share this, not a Google Drive of random links
Recruiters: This screams “Founder who executes”, not “tutorial dev”

Brutal advice (listen carefully)
Do NOT add more sections.​
Do NOT add screenshots everywhere.​
Do NOT list 20 tools.
If you want next upgrades, we can:
1.​
2.​
3.​
4.​

🔥 Rewrite this for investors
🔥 Turn this into a live portfolio website layout
🔥 Add metrics without lying
🔥 Kill weak products from the narrative

Tell me what you want to optimize for:​
money, credibility, or hiring power.

Alright. I’m going to do this properly — industry-grade, ATS-friendly, no cringe founder
fluff, no student nonsense.​
This is a Full-Stack Developer resume that can survive real hiring screens.
